## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate different approaches to key searching using file indexes. The implemented methods offer insights into how key search algorithms work in different scenarios, helping you understand their efficiency and trade-offs.

## Methods

### Random Search

The `randomSearch` method employs a basic random search strategy to find a key within a given dataset. While simple, this approach may not be optimal for large datasets.

### Unsorted File Index Search

The `unsortedFileIndexSearch` method utilizes an unsorted file index to perform faster key searches. It takes advantage of the order of keys in the index, reducing the search time.

### Sorted File Index Search

The `sortedFileIndexSearch` method uses a sorted file index to achieve efficient key retrieval. By leveraging the sorted order, it employs binary search techniques for faster results.
