## ðŸ“š SearchMethodsDemo

### Overview

`SearchMethodsDemo` demonstrates various key searching methods using file indexes. It includes implementations for:
- Random Search
- Unsorted File Index Search
- Sorted File Index Search

### Key Components

#### Random Search

- **Class:** `RandomSearch`
- **Package:** `org.tuc.randomSearch`
- **Description:** Implements a basic random search strategy to locate a key in a dataset.

#### Unsorted File Index Search

- **Class:** `UnsortedFileIndexSearch`
- **Package:** `org.tuc.unsortedFileIndexSearch`
- **Description:** Provides methods for searching using unsorted file indexes.
  
  - **`searchGivenPage(targetKey, dataPage, stringLength, dataPairFile)`**: Searches for a key within a specific data page.
  - **`searchInUnsortedFile(targetKey, unsortedFile)`**: Searches for a key in an unsorted file index.

#### Sorted File Index Search

- **Class:** `SortedFileIndexSearch`
- **Package:** `org.tuc.sortedFileIndexSearch`
- **Description:** Methods for binary and data page searches on a sorted file.
  
  - **`binarySearch(key, sortedFile)`**: Performs a binary search on a sorted file.
  - **`searchDataPage(targetKey, dataPage, stringLength, dataPairFile)`**: Searches for a key within a specific data page of a data pair file.

## ðŸŒ³ B+ Tree Complexity Tester

### Overview

The **B+ Tree Complexity Tester** assesses the efficiency of a B+ tree for indexing words from textual data across multiple files. It includes:

- A robust B+ tree implementation
- File reading capabilities
- Linked list storage for word occurrences

### Key Features

- **B+ Tree Implementation:** Efficiently manages word occurrences.
- **File Reading:** Extracts words and builds a B+ tree.
- **Linked List Storage:** Associates words with file and position information using linked lists.

### Usage

For both projects, follow these steps to run the program:

1. **Download the JAR File:**
   - From the [releases page](https://github.com/CodeMaestro1/BPlusTree-LinkedList-Complexity/releases) for the B+ Tree Tester.
   - For `SearchMethodsDemo`, download from the repository's release section.

2. **Place Input Files:**
   - Put the text files you want to test in the same directory as the JAR file.

3. **Run the Program:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory with the JAR file and input files.
   - Execute the program using:
     ```bash
     java -jar [YourJARFileName].jar
     ```
   - Replace `[YourJARFileName]` with `SearchMethodsDemo` or `BplusTreeComplexityTester` as appropriate.
